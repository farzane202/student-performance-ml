Student Grade Prediction

This project is a small machine learning application where I built a model to predict a student’s final grade (G3) using different academic and personal features.
I used the Student Performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and experimented with different regression models to see which one performs better.
The goal is to predict:
 the final grade of the student
 Models Used
 • Linear Regression
 • K-Nearest Neighbors (with scaling)

 How to Run
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Install dependencies
